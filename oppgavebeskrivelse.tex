\section*{Problem description}
We wish to implement the image processing method developed in the project thesis from the fall of 2016. It should be implemented on a mobile single board computer with the necessary processing power for computer vision applications. A camera system will also need to be integrated with the single board computer. The goal is to develop a computer that can be mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle such as a quadcopter. There are several pieces of information the image processing method requires from the drone, and needs to be discussed.\\ 


Moments in the thesis should include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Determine a single board computer suitable for our application
\item Determine a camera that is compatible with this computer and the camera characteristics needed for the image processing method
\item Implement the image processing method on the single board computer 
\item Implement communication from the single board computer to a PC
\item Determine how information such as attitude, height and position can be extracted from the drone, and what the difficulties are with respect to the accuracy of this information
\end{itemize}
