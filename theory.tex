In order for my single-board computer to be able to extract useful information from the digital images it receives, it has to use fundamentals from image processing and mapping theory together to create a complete mapping system. There are also some requirements in terms of the processing power in the single-board computer, and to be able to run the mapping algorithm in a timely manner, these needs to be met. \\

The following section presents the theoretic basis for image processing and mapping, some sensor theory, as well as the requirements on the single-board computer. The theory section will share many similarities with the project report\cite{kris} I wrote fall of 2016 for Tor Onshus. The same fundamentals are being used in this thesis, but in terms of implementation; they vary. The theory section will focus on the theory for the techniques actually employed in the implementation, and less on presenting all the available techniques and selecting which ones to implement.
