# Master-thesis
Source code for Bj√∏rnsen, 2017. Master thesis for the Department of Engineering Cybernetics at NTNU, Trondheim.

Abstract:
This master thesis features the implementation of a complete image processing, mapping and communication system on a credit card-sized computer, the Raspberry Pi, for the characterization and mapping of a maze from the air using a drone. The system was implemented in Python and has been verified in real-life testing scenarios.

The system captures an image, detects the wall segments of the maze in the image and through the integration of sensors the system calculates the real life lengths and position of the walls. The system is designed to be run remotely, and incorporates a communication platform for the exchange of mapping data.
